# Redpanda Provider

The Redpanda provider is designed for managing Redpanda clusters and Kafka resources in Redpanda Dedicated and Cloud environments. It supports the provisioning, management, and configuration of clusters and Kafka resources, facilitating seamless integration into Terraform workflows.

It is also able to provide management of Kafka resources (topics, ACLs, and more) within Redpanda clusters deployed outside of Redpanda Cloud.

## Authentication with Redpanda Cloud

This provider requires a `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication with Redpanda Cloud services, enabling users to securely manage their Redpanda resources. You can get these by creating an account in [Redpanda Cloud](https://cloudv2.redpanda.com/home) and then [creating a client in the Redpanda Cloud UI](https://cloudv2.redpanda.com/clients).
