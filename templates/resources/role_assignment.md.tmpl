  A role assignment is used for attaching one user to a role.
---

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Assigns an existing Redpanda role to a principal. Resource ID format: `{role_name}:{principal}`

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/docs/role_assignment/main.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Role assignments can be imported using the format `role_name:principal`:

```shell
terraform import {{.Name}}.test "test-role:test-user"
```

Note: The `cluster_api_url` must be specified in your Terraform configuration. The import will validate the role assignment exists during the next `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.

## Notes

- The role must already exist before it can be assigned. Roles are typically created using `rpk security role create` or through the Redpanda Console.
- The principal should be specified as just the username (e.g., `"john.doe"`). The `User:` prefix is not needed and will be automatically stripped if provided.
- Role assignments are atomic operations - you cannot update an existing assignment. To change a role assignment, delete and recreate the resource.
- The resource uses the Redpanda gRPC SecurityService (via console endpoint) for role management operations.
