# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

Enables the provisioning and management of Redpanda clusters on AWS and GCP. A cluster must always have a network and resource group.

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Usage

### On AWS

{{ tffile "examples/cluster/aws/main.tf" }}

### On GCP

{{ tffile "examples/cluster/gcp/main.tf" }}

### On Azure

{{ tffile "examples/cluster/azure/main.tf" }}

## BYOC

This configuration of cluster allows the end user to provide access to their cloud account to the provider so that it can create the necessary infrastructure in their account rather than in Redpanda's Cloud.

#### Additional Requirements

To build a BYOC cluster you must provide credentials that enable the provider to authenticate to the relevant cloud provider. How this works will depend on which cloud provider you are using.

### AWS BYOC

To create a BYOC AWS cluster you must provide an AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. The account [must have fairly wide ranging permissions](https://docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud/security/authorization/cloud-iam-policies/) to create the necessary infrastructure.

### GCP BYOC

To create a GCP BYOC cluster you must provide a GCP_PROJECT_ID and GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS. We also accept the credentials encoded in base64 format if you use GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_BASE64. The account [must have fairly wide ranging permissions](https://docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud/security/authorization/cloud-iam-policies-gcp/) to create the necessary infrastructure.

{{ tffile "examples/byoc/gcp/main.tf" }}

### Azure BYOC

To create a BYOC Azure cluster you must provide Azure credentials, be logged in to the Azure CLI, or specify an Azure authentication method. This provider supports [the same authentication methods and environment variables as the official AzureRM provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli). For example, to use a service principal and client certificate, you can pass the environment variables `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, and `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

The account [must have fairly wide ranging permissions](https://docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud/security/authorization/cloud-iam-policies-azure/) to create the necessary infrastructure.

## BYOVPC

![Beta Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-beta-red.svg)

This feature is in beta and is still under development or awaiting fixes. It can be used at some risk.

This accepts a network and other elements created by the end user inside their cloud provider account (currently limited to AWS) and builds a Redpanda Cluster inside it.

There is [a module](https://github.com/redpanda-data/terraform-aws-redpanda-byovpc) provided for convenience of the end user here that handles the necessary setup. It contains outputs for the inputs the provider requires.

### AWS BYOVPC

![Beta Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-beta-red.svg)

This feature is in beta and is still under development or awaiting fixes. It can be used at some risk.

Has the same requirements as the AWS BYOC Cluster in addition to ARNs for numerous resources that the end user must create.

{{ tffile "examples/byovpc/aws/main.tf" }}

### GCP BYOVPC

![Beta Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-beta-red.svg)

This feature is in beta and is still under development or awaiting fixes. It can be used at some risk.

Has the same requirements as the GCP BYOC Cluster along with the additional requirement for numerous resources that the end user must create.

{{ tffile "examples/byovpc/gcp/main.tf" }}

## Limitations

We are not currently able to support Azure BYOVPC clusters.

### Example Usage of a data source BYOC to manage users and ACLs

{{ tffile "examples/datasource/standard/main.tf" }}

## Import

```shell
terraform import {{.Name}}.example clusterId
```
