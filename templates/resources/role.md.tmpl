## Role Naming Best Practices

When choosing role names:
- Use **descriptive names** that clearly indicate purpose (`DataEngineers`, `ReadOnlyAnalysts`)
- **Align with responsibilities**: Reflect actual job functions and organizational structure
- **Prefer specificity**: Create specific roles rather than overly broad ones (`TopicReaders` vs `SuperUsers`)
- Roles cannot be renamed once created - choose names carefully

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/docs/role/main.tf" }}

## Usage with Role Assignment

Roles created with this resource can be assigned to users using the `redpanda_role_assignment` resource:

```terraform
resource "redpanda_role" "developer" {
  name            = "developer"
  cluster_api_url = var.cluster_api_url
  allow_deletion  = true
}

resource "redpanda_role_assignment" "dev_assignment" {
  role_name       = redpanda_role.developer.name
  principal       = "john.doe"
  cluster_api_url = var.cluster_api_url
}
```

## Deletion Protection

By default, `allow_deletion` is set to `false` to prevent accidental deletion of roles. Set this to `true` if you want Terraform to be able to delete the role when the resource is destroyed.

If `allow_deletion` is `false` and the resource is destroyed, the role will remain in Redpanda but will be removed from Terraform state.

## Important: Deletion Behavior

When a role is deleted (with `allow_deletion = true`):
- **All ACLs assigned to the role are automatically deleted**
- **All user assignments to the role are automatically removed**
- **This operation is irreversible**

Consider the impact on users and permissions before deleting roles. It's recommended to review all role assignments and associated ACLs before enabling deletion.

## Import

```shell
terraform import {{.Name}}.example roleName,clusterId
```

Where `clusterId` is the ID of the cluster in Redpanda Cloud.
