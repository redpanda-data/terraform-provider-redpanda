{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/docs/acl/main.tf" }}

## Limitations

We are not currently able to support ACL creation in self hosted clusters. This is an area of active development so expect that to change soon.

## Import

We do not support the import of ACLs into the Redpanda provider at this time.
