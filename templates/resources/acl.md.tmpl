{{ .Description | trimspace }}

Creates an Access Control List (ACL) in a Redpanda cluster.

## Usage

{{ tffile "examples/user-acl-topic/main.tf" }}

## Limitations

We are not currently able to support ACL creation in self hosted clusters. This is an area of active development so expect that to change soon.
