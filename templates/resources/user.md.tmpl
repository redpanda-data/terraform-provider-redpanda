Creates a topic in a Redpanda Cluster

## Usage

{{ tffile "examples/user-acl-topic/main.tf" }}

## Security Considerations

We recommend storing user passwords in a secret store and only passing them in at runtime. They are marked sensitive and will not be shown in plan or apply output.

However it is worth remembering that [marking a field sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/sensitive-state) does not obscure it or encrypt it in state and that terraform offers limited support on this matter.

Be cognizant of the security implications of storing sensitive data in state and consider using a secure state backend for your state files.

## Limitations

We are not currently able to support user creation in self hosted clusters. This is an area of active development so expect that to change soon.
