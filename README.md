# Redpanda Terraform Provider

![Alpha Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-alpha-red.svg)

> **Warning**: This is an alpha release. All features are subject to change and may not be fully supported at this time.

The Redpanda Terraform Provider is a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) plugin that allows you to create and manage
resources on [Redpanda Cloud](https://redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud).

## Getting Started

User documentation on the Terraform provider is available at
the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/redpanda-data/redpanda/latest/docs).

## Makefile Commands - Developer Guide

This guide provides an overview of the key Makefile commands used in the development and testing of the Redpanda
Terraform Provider. These commands help streamline the development process, manage Redpanda clusters for testing, and
ensure code quality.

### Prerequisites

Before using these commands, ensure you have the following:

- Go installed on your system
- Terraform CLI installed
- Access to a Redpanda Cloud account with appropriate permissions
- Required environment variables set (REDPANDA_CLIENT_ID, REDPANDA_CLIENT_SECRET)

### Cluster Management Commands

These commands are used to create and manage Redpanda clusters for testing purposes.

#### standup

Creates and sets up a Redpanda cluster using Terraform. This is intended for use in manual testing and development. It
should not be active when running the integration tests or you will lose the cluster ID and name.

Here's an example usage

```shell
# Test type defaults to cluster
# Cloud provider defaults to aws
make standup 
# make changes to examples/cluster/aws/main.tf
# rerun standup to review
make standup

# switch to datasource to test accessing the cluster with datasource and creating resources
# this is convenient for manual testing of changes to dataplane resources
# make changes in examples/datasource/standard/main.tf
export TEST_TYPE=datasource
make standup

# switch to GCP to validate cluster against GCP. 
# Note that you won't lose your AWS state or cluster when doing this
export TEST_TYPE=cluster
export CLOUD_PROVIDER=gcp

# clean up by tearing down the GCP cluster
make teardown

# switch back to AWS and cleanup
export CLOUD_PROVIDER=aws
make teardown
```

Command: `make standup`

**Key Variables:**

- `REDPANDA_CLIENT_ID`: Redpanda Cloud client ID
- `REDPANDA_CLIENT_SECRET`: Redpanda Cloud client secret
- `REDPANDA_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT`: Redpanda Cloud environment (ign or prod)
- `TF_CONFIG_DIR`: Terraform configuration directory (auto-generated)
- `CLOUD_PROVIDER`: Cloud provider (e.g., aws, azure, gcp)
- `TEST_TYPE`: Type of test (e.g., cluster, datasource)

The `TF_CONFIG_DIR` is dynamically constructed based on the `TEST_TYPE` and `CLOUD_PROVIDER`:

For cluster tests: `TF_CONFIG_DIR := examples/$(TEST_TYPE)/$(CLOUD_PROVIDER)`
For datasource tests: `TF_CONFIG_DIR := examples/$(TEST_TYPE)/$(DATASOURCE_TEST_DIR)`

This is done to enable persisting the name and id of a cluster created by standup while still allowing for name
randomization. Names and IDs are persisted by cloud provider, so you can switch between providers without losing them.
You can also switch from the cluster test to the datasource test and the correct cluster will be reused depending on the
cloud provider you have set.

#### teardown

Destroys the current Redpanda cluster and associated infrastructure managed by Terraform.

Command: `make teardown`

This command uses the same `TF_CONFIG_DIR` as the `standup` command to ensure it targets the correct resources.

### Development Commands

These commands assist in code development, testing, and maintenance.

#### ready

Prepares the project by generating documentation, running linters, and tidying dependencies.

Command: `make ready`

This command is useful to run before committing changes to ensure code quality and up-to-date documentation.

#### unit

Runs unit tests for the project.

Command: `make unit`

**Note:** This command uses dummy credentials and does not run cluster tests.

#### int

Runs integration tests for the project.

Command: `make int`

**Important:** This command requires valid Redpanda credentials and will create actual resources in your Redpanda Cloud
account.

#### mock

Cleans and regenerates mock files used in testing.

Command: `make mock`

Mocks are generated using mockgen from specific interfaces as defined in redpanda/mocks/mocks.go. Once you have tagged
them with go generate, you can run this command to generate the mocks.

### Best Practices

1. Always run `make ready` before committing changes to ensure code quality and documentation accuracy.
2. Use `make unit` for quick, local testing that doesn't require Redpanda credentials.
3. Use `standup` and `teardown` for more complex manual testing during development
4. Run the integration tests by tagging your PR with `ci-ready` to ensure all tests pass before merging.

## Contributing

When contributing to this project, please ensure you've run `make ready` and all tests pass before submitting a pull
request. If you've added new functionality, consider adding appropriate unit and integration tests.

## Releasing a Version

Do not change the Terraform Registry Manifest version! This is the version of the protocol, not the provider. To release
a version cut a release in GitHub. Goreleaser will handle things from there.
