  The Redpanda Data Terraform provider is used to manage Redpanda Dedicated and Cloud clusters and Kafka resources within them. To use the provider to connect to a Redpanda Cloud cluster, you need to provide a client_id and client_secret.
  Example Usage
  This example demonstrates how to use the Redpanda Terraform provider with various fields populated with dummy values. Ensure you replace these values with your actual data.
  ```hcl
  provider "redpanda" {
    clientid      = "yourclientid"
    clientsecret  = "yourclientsecret"
    cloud_provider = "AWS" # Supported values: GCP, AWS
    region         = "us-west-2"
    zones          = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
  }
  Define a Redpanda cluster resource
  resource "redpandacluster" "examplecluster" {
    name           = "example-cluster"
    cloudprovider = "AWS"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    nodecount     = 3
    zones          = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
    # Other necessary configuration here...
  }
  ```
  This configuration sets up the provider to manage resources in the AWS cloud, specifying the client_id and client_secret for authentication. The cloud_provider, region, and zones fields define where the resources will be located. The redpanda_cluster resource example shows how you could define a cluster with these settings.
  Remember to replace your_client_id and your_client_secret with your actual credentials and adjust the cloud_provider, region, and zones according to your deployment needs.

# redpanda Provider

The Redpanda Data Terraform provider is used to manage Redpanda Dedicated and Cloud clusters and Kafka resources within them. To use the provider to connect to a Redpanda Cloud cluster, you need to provide a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### Example Usage

This example demonstrates how to use the Redpanda Terraform provider with various fields populated with dummy values. Ensure you replace these values with your actual data.

```hcl
provider "redpanda" {
  client_id      = "your_client_id"
  client_secret  = "your_client_secret"
  cloud_provider = "AWS" # Supported values: GCP, AWS
  region         = "us-west-2"
  zones          = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
}

# Define a Redpanda cluster resource
resource "redpanda_cluster" "example_cluster" {
  name           = "example-cluster"
  cloud_provider = "AWS"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  node_count     = 3
  zones          = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  # Other necessary configuration here...
}
```

This configuration sets up the provider to manage resources in the AWS cloud, specifying the `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication. The `cloud_provider`, `region`, and `zones` fields define where the resources will be located. The `redpanda_cluster` resource example shows how you could define a cluster with these settings.

Remember to replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with your actual credentials and adjust the `cloud_provider`, `region`, and `zones` according to your deployment needs.
