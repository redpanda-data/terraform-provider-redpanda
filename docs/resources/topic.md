## Schema

### Optional

- `allow_deletion` (Boolean) Indicates whether the topic can be deleted.
- `configuration` (Map of String) A map of string key/value pairs of topic configurations.
- `partition_count` (Number) The number of partitions for the topic. This determines how the data is distributed across brokers.
- `replication_factor` (Number) The replication factor for the topic, which defines how many copies of the data are kept across different brokers for fault tolerance.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
