# redpanda_topic (Resource)

Topic represents a Kafka topic configuration

Creates a topic in a Redpanda Cluster

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_api_url` (String) The cluster API URL. Changing this will prevent deletion of the resource on the existing cluster. It is generally a better idea to delete an existing resource and create a new one than to change this value unless you are planning to do state imports
- `name` (String) The name of the topic.

### Optional

- `allow_deletion` (Boolean) Indicates whether the topic can be deleted.
- `configuration` (Map of String) A map of string key/value pairs of topic configurations.
- `partition_count` (Number) The number of partitions for the topic. This determines how the data is distributed across brokers. Increases are fully supported without data loss. Decreases will destroy and recreate the topic if allow_deletion is set to true (defaults to false).
- `replication_factor` (Number) The replication factor for the topic, which defines how many copies of the data are kept across different brokers for fault tolerance.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "redpanda" {}

resource "redpanda_resource_group" "example" {
  name = "example-resource-group"
}

resource "redpanda_network" "example" {
  name              = "example-network"
  resource_group_id = redpanda_resource_group.example.id
  cloud_provider    = "aws"
  region            = "us-west-2"
  cluster_type      = "dedicated"
  cidr_block        = "10.0.0.0/20"
}

resource "redpanda_cluster" "example" {
  name              = "example-cluster"
  resource_group_id = redpanda_resource_group.example.id
  network_id        = redpanda_network.example.id
  cloud_provider    = "aws"
  region            = "us-west-2"
  cluster_type      = "dedicated"
  connection_type   = "public"
  throughput_tier   = "tier-1-aws"
  zones             = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
}

resource "redpanda_topic" "example" {
  name               = "example-topic"
  partition_count    = 3
  replication_factor = 3
  cluster_api_url    = redpanda_cluster.example.cluster_api_url
  configuration = {
    "cleanup.policy" = "delete"
    "retention.ms"   = "604800000"
  }
}
```

## Limitations

We are not currently able to support topic creation in self hosted clusters. This is an area of active development so expect that to change soon.

## Import

```shell
terraform import redpanda_topic.example topicName,clusterId
```

Where clusterId is the ID of the cluster in Redpanda Cloud
