## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_api_url` (String) The cluster API URL. Changing this will prevent deletion of the resource on the existing cluster. It is generally a better idea to delete an existing resource and create a new one than to change this value unless you are planning to do state imports
- `host` (String) The host address to use for this ACL

- `principal` (String) The principal to apply this ACL for
- `resource_name` (String) The name of the resource this ACL entry will be on
- `resource_pattern_type` (String) The pattern type of the resource. It determines the strategy how the provided resource name is matched (LITERAL, MATCH, PREFIXED, etc ...) against the actual resource names

### Read-Only
