# redpanda_user (Resource)

User is a user that can be created in Redpanda

Creates a user in a Redpanda Cluster.

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_api_url` (String) The cluster API URL. Changing this will prevent deletion of the resource on the existing cluster. It is generally a better idea to delete an existing resource and create a new one than to change this value unless you are planning to do state imports
- `name` (String) Name of the user, must be unique
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password of the user

### Optional

- `allow_deletion` (Boolean) Allows deletion of the user. If false, the user cannot be deleted and the resource will be removed from the state on destruction. Defaults to false.
- `mechanism` (String) Which authentication method to use, see https://docs.redpanda.com/current/manage/security/authentication/ for more information

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "redpanda" {}

resource "redpanda_resource_group" "example" {
  name = "example-resource-group"
}

resource "redpanda_network" "example" {
  name              = "example-network"
  resource_group_id = redpanda_resource_group.example.id
  cloud_provider    = "aws"
  region            = "us-west-2"
  cluster_type      = "dedicated"
  cidr_block        = "10.0.0.0/20"
}

resource "redpanda_cluster" "example" {
  name              = "example-cluster"
  resource_group_id = redpanda_resource_group.example.id
  network_id        = redpanda_network.example.id
  cloud_provider    = "aws"
  region            = "us-west-2"
  cluster_type      = "dedicated"
  connection_type   = "public"
  throughput_tier   = "tier-1-aws"
  zones             = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
}

resource "redpanda_user" "example" {
  name            = "example-user"
  password        = "secure-password-123"
  mechanism       = "scram-sha-256"
  cluster_api_url = redpanda_cluster.example.cluster_api_url
}
```

## Security Considerations

We recommend storing user passwords in a secret store and only passing them in at runtime. They are marked sensitive and will not be shown in plan or apply output.

However it is worth remembering that [marking a field sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/sensitive-state) does not obscure it or encrypt it in state and that terraform offers limited support on this matter.

Be cognizant of the security implications of storing sensitive data in state and consider using a secure state backend for your state files.

## Limitations

We are not currently able to support user creation in self hosted clusters. This is an area of active development so expect that to change soon.

## Import

```shell
terraform import redpanda_user.example userName,clusterId
```

Where clusterId is the ID of the cluster in Redpanda Cloud
